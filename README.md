## Hi, I'm Romera!

I'm a software developer that enjoys to solve problems and learn with them to make life easier

I focus mainly on Web Development, both backend and frontend, but sometimes I like to step outside this bubble and work on other projects. These include scripts to automate something in my (or my teams) daily routine or silly little games

Currently I'm learning Java/Spring Boot and Rust
