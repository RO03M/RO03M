### Hey
- My name is Gabriel Romera, I'm a guy from Brazil, sad honestly.
- I have been "programming" since 2016, started developing simple applications for web, and now I'm focusing more in games and apps for desktop (sometimes for mobile too)
- I have experience in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js, React Native (With Expo), Electron.js, jQuery, C# (For desktop and Unity), Java, PHP and Python.
- If I would rank which languages I most used, it would be: #1 JavaScript, #2 PHP, #3 Java
